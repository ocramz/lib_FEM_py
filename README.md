# lib_FEM_py
2D Finite Element library, with extensions for micro-manufacturing simulation

## Notes on the FE model
The library implements a 2D Galerkin FE method for solving the Helmholtz wave equation with PML boundary conditions [1] in the linear regime; I wrote it during my PhD to simulate the propagation of optical waves in transparent dielectrics, such as fiber optics or silicon photonic waveguides.


## Notes on the micro-manufacturing model
The extensions mentioned above serve to model a spatial "diffusion" of the material coefficients, and subsequent transformations thereof that occur during manufacturing of silicon photonic devices ("integrated optics"). 
In particular, we include: 

1. a simplified etching photoresist development model ("RD" stands for "reaction-diffusion"). This is modeled as an initial value problem, via a pair of ODEs that capture the two reacting species (resist polymer and diffusing photo-acid catalyst)
2. an idealised etching step of the resulting material distribution map (a thresholding nonlinearity)
